							A Machine Learning Approach to Protein Fold Recognition

								Outline of the Project

																14th January 2017


1. See what is causing a protein to be in a particular family

2. Supervised learning for teaching the system which family a particular protein is belonging to. 
In this, first let the system classify the protein in a particular class according to what it knows
Then tell the system what class that protein actually belongs to
This will let the system detect and learn anomalies if any are present

3. Since a protein is not like a discrete number we will have extent(in percentages) to which a protein will belong to a family. (This is an assumption. We need to confirm this)
By this what we mean is, take a number say 1, we can say with 100% surety that it will belong to families like natural numbers, whole numbers, etc. But this is not the case with proteins. A protein might belong to a particular family X with say 70% surety but there might also be chances that it belongs to another family Y and its chances might be 40%.

4. Now finally use an unsupervised algorithm to let the system classify protein on its own.
